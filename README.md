# AppDynamics Nginx - Monitoring Extension

##Use Case

Nginx is an open-source HTTP server and reverse proxy, and an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. The Nginx monitoring extension gets metrics from the nginx server and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

Metrics include:
* Active connections
* Total number of requests
* Accepted and handled requests
* Reading, writing, and waiting


##Installation

**Note**: For the following steps to work, nginx should be running with &quot;--with-http_stub_status_module&quot; enabled as well as a stub status on in the nginx.conf.Â 
See the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpStubStatusModule">nginx wiki</a> for more information</td>.

1. Type 'ant package' in the command line from the nginx-monitoring-extension directory
2. Deploy the file NginxMonitor.zip found in the 'dist' directory into \<machineagent install dir\>/monitors/
3. Unzip the deployed file
4. Restart the machineagent
5. In the AppDynamics Metric Browser, look for: Application Infrastructure Performance  | \<Tier\> | Custom Metrics | WebServer | NGinX | Status.
